# Leaf_Projectt
Exercise Description

In this exercise, students are required to build a Machine Learning-based Leaf Detection System that can process leaf images and classify them as either healthy, diseased, or based on species. The goal is to apply image preprocessing, feature extraction, and ML/DL techniques (like CNN or SVM) to create a functional plant leaf detection model.
This system should support real-world applications in precision agriculture, plant disease monitoring, and botanical research.

Requirements:
Data Collection:
Use the PlantVillage dataset or custom-collected leaf images.
Include at least 3 classes (e.g., healthy, diseased, different species).

Preprocessing:
Resize images to a consistent size.
Normalize and apply noise reduction techniques.
Segment leaves from the background.

Feature Extraction:
Use shape, texture, and color-based features if using traditional ML.
If using DL (e.g., CNN), rely on automatic feature extraction.

Model Implementation:
Option 1: Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for deep learning classification.
Option 2: Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) or other ML algorithms with manually extracted features.

Model Evaluation:
Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Display confusion matrix for multiclass performance.
User Interface (Optional but recommended)

Create a simple GUI or notebook-based interface to upload and test new leaf images.

Documentation:
Add a clear explanation of each step in code and a README.md file with:
